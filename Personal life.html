  Raised Jewish, Zuckerberg once identified as an atheist but has since revised his views. In 2016, he said: "I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important."[22][181][182]

He met his then-future wife, fellow Harvard student Priscilla Chan, at a fraternity party during his sophomore year there. They began dating in 2003.[183][184]

In September 2010, Zuckerberg invited Chan, by then a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco,[185] to move into his rented Palo Alto house. He studied Mandarin in preparation for the couple's visit to China in December 2010.[186][187] On May 19, 2012, they married in his backyard in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.[188][189][190] On July 31, 2015, Zuckerberg announced that they were expecting a baby girl and revealed that Chan had experienced three miscarriages previously.[191] On December 1, Zuckerberg announced the birth of their daughter, Maxima Chan Zuckerberg ("Max").[192][193] The couple announced in their Chinese New Year video that Maxima's official Chinese name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: 陈明宇).[194] They welcomed their second daughter, August, in August 2017.[195] Their Puli dog, Beast,[196] has over two million followers on Facebook.[197]

In 2017, he bought 700 acres of land on Kauai, Hawaii, for over $100 million using a controversial legal tactic which compels owners of undeveloped land to sell it at public auction.[198][199]
